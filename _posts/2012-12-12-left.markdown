Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for [Jekyll][jekyll].

This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own blog. It was
extracted from [zachholman.com][zh], which means it was battle-hardened from
years of posting serious blog posts about emoji and swear words.

```python
import tflearn
from tflearn.layers.conv import conv_2d, max_pool_2d
from tflearn.layers.core import input_data, dropout, fully_connected
from tflearn.layers.estimator import regression
from tflearn.layers.normalization import local_response_normalization
import tensorflow as tf

def dist_sq(prediction, target):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(prediction - target), name='dist_sq')

def alexnet(width, height, lr):
    network = input_data(shape=[None, height, width, 1], name='input')
    network = conv_2d(network, 96, 11, strides=4, activation='relu')
    network = max_pool_2d(network, 3, strides=2)
    network = local_response_normalization(network)
    network = conv_2d(network, 256, 5, activation='relu')
    network = max_pool_2d(network, 3, strides=2)
    network = local_response_normalization(network)
    network = conv_2d(network, 384, 3, activation='relu')
    network = conv_2d(network, 384, 3, activation='relu')
    network = conv_2d(network, 256, 3, activation='relu')
    network = max_pool_2d(network, 3, strides=2)

You're actually reading an example post right now. See how cool it is? Oh, be
quiet, you're making me blush.

You'll want to [get the code][left] and read the README to learn how to
install and set up Left for your own purposes.
