title: Crowd Dynamics

Crowds are an example of a complex system that displays emergent behaviour. Such behaviour is a result of the aggregation of interactions between many individuals. Understanding crowd dynamics is very important in a growing society and can have wide reaching benefits in design, safety and transport. Understanding group behaviour has even further potential for applications involving animal behaviour, cell growth and emerging fields such as swarm intelligence. The goal of this project was to create an implementation of a flexible crowd model that was capable of exploring and describing some frequently observed crowd phenomena. The ultimate goal was applying the model to common evacuation scenarios and identifing the role of exits and obstacles to evacuation speed and the danger of crushing due to high pressure zones.
